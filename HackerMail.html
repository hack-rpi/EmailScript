            <p>Hello {contact_name},</p>

            <p>
            Our team is thrilled to announce <strong>HackRPI 2025</strong> – the upcoming annual HackRPI event taking place in the fall. 
            We will be hosting this event on <strong>November 15–16</strong> at 
            <a href="https://www.rpi.edu" style="color:#0066cc; text-decoration:none;">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in Troy, New York.
            </p>

            <p>
            HackRPI is a student-run organization that hosts annual hackathons at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
            We firmly believe hackathons are a leading source of innovation and ingenuity. 
            As such, we invite students with diverse programming backgrounds from across the globe to form teams, 
            generate novel ideas, and design original prototypes. 
            Last November’s hackathon had upwards of <strong>500 attendees</strong>, making us the largest hackathon in New York’s Capital District.
